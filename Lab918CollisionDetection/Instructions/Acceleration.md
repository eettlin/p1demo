# Adding Acceleration Vectors: Lab 830#

###Objectives###
 - Understand vector magnitude and direction 
 - Understand vector addition, subtraction
 - Review a little Trig
 


##Part I: Add a Vector constructor function to your lab ##
 - Get the Student_AdvancedAnimation repo from GitHub 
 - Create a folder for lab829vectors


###Part II: Understand Vectors###

 -  Magnitude and Direction

 -  Think of the magnitude of a vector as the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle.  
 If the x and y properties of your vector object represent the sides of the triangle, what is the magnitude in terms of x and y? </br>


 -  Think of the direction of a vector as the angle formed by the hypotenuse and one side of the triangle  
If the x and y properties of your vector object represent the sides of the triangle, what is the direction in terms of x and y? </br>
 
###Part III: Create Getters and Setters for the Vector Magnitude and Direction ###

 -  Study the code that creates a canvas and a context.  Use the patterns above to create four balls and animate each:
